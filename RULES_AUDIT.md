# RULES_AUDIT

This file was recreated to reflect the post-clean working set. It contains a minimal audit note.

- Recreated a small subset of exported rules in `support_app/rules.yaml` (ids: 1,3,100)
- Recommend running `python support_app/rule_import.py support_app/rules.yaml` to validate full rules before bulk import.
